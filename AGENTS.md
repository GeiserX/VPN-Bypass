### Important Files to Read First
Before making changes, read these files to understand the project:
- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md

### CI/CD & Infrastructure
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions

## Best Practices

- **Write clean code**: Prioritize readability and maintainability
- **Handle errors properly**: Don't ignore errors, handle them appropriately
- **Consider security**: Review code for potential security vulnerabilities
- **Conventional commits**: Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:, refactor:, test:, style:)
- **Semantic versioning**: Follow semver (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for version numbers

## Self-Improving Configuration

This file should evolve as we work together:
1. Track coding patterns and preferences
2. Note corrections made to suggestions
3. Update periodically with learned preferences

## ⚠️ Security Notice

> **Do not commit secrets to the repository or to the live app.**
> Always use secure standards to transmit sensitive information.
> Use environment variables, secret managers, or secure vaults for credentials.

**🔍 Security Audit Recommendation:** When making changes that involve authentication, data handling, API endpoints, or dependencies, proactively offer to perform a security review of the affected code.
